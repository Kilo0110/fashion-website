# Fashion Website - Built with Nuxt3, TailwindCSS and Firebase

A fashion e-commerce :womans_clothes: :shopping_cart: website built with Nuxt3, TailwindCSS and Firebase. Design is based off this [design](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1147905034814811088).

Fork (or clone) this repo and run the following :point_down: to install its dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

After which run :point_down: to spin up a local dev server

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

## TODO :clipboard: :spiral_notepad:

- Complete design and link up pages
- Connect database and implement authentication and security
- Create a desktop view (still undecided)

## Known Issues :disappointed:

- This project, as of this moment, is solely meant to be viewed on mobile devices. A desktop view is yet to be decided.

- While I'll tried my best to recreate the design, it isn't an exact 1-to-1 particularly in the icons
